Portfolio Project
Introduction
Welcome to my Portfolio project! This project is a personal portfolio website that showcases my skills, experiences, and projects. The portfolio provides information about me, my objectives, skills, work experiences, and notable projects I have undertaken.

Project Structure
The project consists of two main files: index.html and style.css.

index.html
The HTML file (index.html) structures the content of the portfolio. It includes sections for an introduction, objectives, skills, work experience, and projects. Each section provides relevant information, and buttons are included for easy navigation to external links such as LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

style.css
The CSS file (style.css) provides styling to enhance the visual appeal of the portfolio. It defines the color scheme, fonts, and layout for different sections of the website. The styling is designed to create a professional and visually appealing presentation.

How to Use
